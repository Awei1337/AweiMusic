How did you know?
It's what I've always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table?
I'm trying (I just live), will somebody make her (I live day by day)
Shut up about it? Can we settle down, please? (Fighting demons)

I smoked away my brain, I think I'm going dumb
Cocaine up on my gums, I think they're going numb
I'm having stomach pains, now I'm throwing up
'Cause I'm a microphone fiend, give me the bass
Give me the beat, now let me lean, tap the vein, let it stream

Feel the pain, young Martin Luther King, with a dream
That one day me and my team, we can make it with this rapping
And now, we're swagging, making money in Manhattan, trick, what's happening?
They try to intellect with indirection just to test you
A rebel until my death, it's in my flesh, it's in my vessels

Fuck the clique you're with, I'm finna fuck the bitch you're next to
Fuck a metro sexual, suck a dick, I'm disrespectful
You know the kid get it, get-get sick, spit
Clip spit, quick split, quick hit, kids women
Oh, that's your girl, huh? Well, I just hit it
It's A$AP, nigga, live with it, swag

Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they start to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Add it to your thoughts

Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they start to drown me
Lord, don't leave me all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Add it to your thoughts

Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (it's what I-, I think-)
(Bite tongue, deep breaths) let the beat chill
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (it's what I-, I think-)
(Bite tongue, deep breaths) let the beat chill
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (it's what I-, I think-)
(Bite tongue, deep breaths) let the beat chill
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (it's what I-, I think-)
(Bite tongue, deep breaths) hipster by heart, but I can tell you how the streets feel

Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
