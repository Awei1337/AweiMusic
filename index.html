How did you know?
It's what I've always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table?
I'm trying, will somebody make her (I just live, I live day by day)
Shut up about it, can we settle down please? (Fighting demons)

I smoked away my brain, I think I'm going dumb
Cocaine up on my gums, I think they're going numb
I'm having stomach pains, now I'm throwing up
'Cause I'm a microphone fiend, give me the bass
Give me the beat, and let me lean, tap the vein, let it stream
Feel the pain, young Martin Luther King, with a dream
That one day me and my team, we can make it with this rapping
Now we swagging, making money in Manhattan, trick, what's happening?
They try to intellect with indirection just to test you
A rebel until my death, it's in my flesh, it's in my vessels
Fuck the clique you with, I'm finna fuck the bitch you next to
Fuck a metrosexual, suck a dick, I'm disrespectful
You know the kid get it, get-get sick spit
Clip spit quick split quick hit kids women
Oh, that's your girl, huh? Well, I just hit it
It's A$AP nigga, live with it, swag

Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they start to drown me, lord, don't leave me all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts
These evil thoughts, they start to drown me, lord, don't leave me all alone
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you, add it to your thoughts

Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (it's what I think) (bite tongue, deep breaths)
(Let the beat chill)
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (it's what I think) (bite tongue, deep breaths)
(Let the beat chill)
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (it's what I think) (bite tongue, deep breaths)
(Let the beat chill)
Aw, yeah, aw, yeah (it's what I think) (bite tongue, deep breaths)
(I'm a hipster by heart, but I can tell you how the streets feel)
